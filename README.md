# Capstone Project Instructions

## Deliverables

### **1. Documentation (GitBook)**  
- **Purpose**: Provide comprehensive documentation explaining your project’s design, architecture, implementation, and usage.  
- **Content**:  
  - **Introduction**: Overview of the project, its goals, and target audience.  
  - **User Guide**: Step-by-step instructions on how to use the application.  
  - **(Optional)**
	  - **System Design**: High-level architecture, technologies used, data flow, UML, flowcharts, or wireframes.  
	  - **Developer Guide**: Setup instructions, dependencies, and contribution guidelines.  
	  - **API Documentation** (if applicable): Endpoints, request/response examples.  
- **Format**: Hosted on [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).  
- **Why?** Helps users and future developers understand and extend your project.  

### **2. Code (GitHub Repository)**
- **Repository Structure**:  
	- `/src` source code
    - `/exe` executables 
	- `README.md` Project overview + **detailed** setup instructions as follows: 
        - Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running your software on both Windows and macOS systems. Your guide should cover **either**:
            - Source Code Compilation (if users need to build from source)
                - Detailed steps to compile the project
                - Required build tools and configurations
            - Pre-built Executable Setup (if providing ready-to-run binaries):
                - Download and installation process
                - Launching the application
        - Clearly list all prerequisites (software dependencies, system requirements, etc.)
        - Include any necessary configuration steps
        - Provide troubleshooting tips for common setup issues

### **3. Presentation Slides**

- **Slides Structure:**

	- Title slide: Project name, team members, supervisor.

	- Problem statement: What issue does your project solve? Why is it important?

	- Competitors & Differentiation:

		- Identify existing solutions in the market that address similar problems. Summarize their core features and limitations.

		- Clearly articulate how your project differs from or improves upon these alternatives. Your Project’s Unique Value. Highlight key differentiators (e.g., enhanced features, better usability, cost efficiency). Differentiation is encouraged but not mandatory. If the project’s purpose is learning, clearly state this. If no differentiators exist, transparently state the project’s primary goal (e.g., educational exploration, proof-of-concept).

	- High-Level use cases: key functionalities.

	- Pitfalls & lessons learned: challenges faced and how you overcame them.

	- Task management: breakdown of team contributions.

- **Delivery tips:**

	- Assign speaking roles to all team members.

	- Practice demos to avoid technical issues during the live run.

	- Font size would be large enough, text should not be dense in slides. 


### **4. Demo Video (2–3 Minutes)**

- **Content Guidelines:**

	- Focus on user experience rather than technical. Showcase the key features.

	- Format: MP4 or YouTube link (upload to a shared drive). Should not be more than 30MB.
